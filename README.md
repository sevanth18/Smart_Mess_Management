📘 Smart Hostel Mess Management System
Forecasting Attendance & Optimizing Food Portions using Data Analytics

A data-driven system designed to help hostel messes predict student attendance, reduce food waste, and optimize portion planning using forecasting, statistical analysis, and interactive dashboards.

🚀 Features

📊 Meal-wise Attendance Forecasting using Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing

🧪 Two-Way ANOVA to analyze the impact of Day and Meal Type

🍽️ Portion Optimization based on waste per plate

📈 Interactive Visualizations for attendance, waste trends, and correlations

🌐 Streamlit Web App for real-time decision support

♻️ 15–20% Reduction in Food Waste using analytics-driven planning

🛠️ Tech Stack

Programming Language:

Python

Libraries Used:

Pandas, NumPy → Data handling

Statsmodels → Forecasting & ANOVA

Matplotlib, Seaborn → Visualizations

📊 Key Components
1. Attendance Forecasting (Holt-Winters)

Uses additive seasonal model

Captures trend + weekly seasonality

Achieved ≈90% prediction accuracy

Forecasts next 7 days with confidence intervals

2. Waste Analysis

Computes waste per plate (in grams)

Identifies high-waste meals

Suggests optimal portion reduction

3. Two-Way ANOVA

Factors analyzed:

Meal Type

Day of the Week

Results:

✔ Meal Type → Significant (p < 0.05)

✘ Day → Not significant

✘ Interaction (Day × Meal) → Not significant

4. Streamlit Dashboard

Provides the following insights:

Attendance & waste trends

Menu lookup by day & meal

Forecasted attendance

Portion recommendations

🧪 How to Run the Project
1. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt


If you don’t have a requirements file:

pip install streamlit pandas numpy statsmodels matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

2. Run the Streamlit Application
streamlit run streamlit_mess_app_final.py

3. Upload the Datasets in the App

Attendance_Data.csv

Food_Wastage.csv

Mess_Menu.csv

📈 Results

✔ Achieved ~20% reduction in estimated food waste

✔ Improved meal planning accuracy using forecasting

✔ Built a real-time decision support tool for mess supervisors
