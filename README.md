📘 Smart Hostel Mess Management System
Forecasting Attendance & Reducing Food Waste Using Data Analytics

A data-driven system designed to help hostel messes predict student attendance, reduce food waste, and optimize portion planning using forecasting models, statistical analysis, and interactive dashboards.


🚀 Features

📊 1. Attendance Forecasting
-->Uses Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing
-->Captures trend + weekly seasonality
-->Achieves ~90% prediction accuracy

🧪 2. Two-Way ANOVA
-->Analyzes the impact of Day and Meal Type
-->Meal Type is statistically significant (p < 0.05)
-->Helps understand attendance variability

🍽️ 3. Portion Optimization
-->Computes waste per plate (grams)
-->Suggests optimized portion sizes
-->Enables 15–20% reduction in food waste

📈 4. Interactive Visualizations
-->Attendance trends
-->Waste per plate patterns
-->Correlation heatmaps

🌐 5. Streamlit Dashboard
-->Real-time forecasting
-->Dynamic UI for ease of use
-->Designed for mess supervisors

📊 Key Components

1. Attendance Forecasting (Holt-Winters)
-->Additive seasonal model
-->Captures meal-wise daily patterns
-->Predicts next 7 days
-->Provides confidence intervals

2. Waste Analysis
-->Computes waste per plate
-->Identifies high-waste meals
-->Supports portion-based decision making

3. Two-Way ANOVA
   
Factors analyzed:
-->Meal Type
-->Day of the Week

Results:
-->Meal Type → Significant (p < 0.05)
-->Day → Not significant
-->Interaction → Not significant

4. Streamlit Dashboard Features
-->Attendance & waste trend charts
-->Menu lookup by Day × Meal
-->Forecasting graph with CI
-->Portion recommendation engine

🧪 How to Run the Project

1. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run the Streamlit App
streamlit run streamlit_mess_app_final.py

3. Upload the Required Datasets
-->Attendance_Data.csv
-->Food_Wastage.csv
-->Mess_Menu.csv

📈 Results
-->Achieved 15–20% reduction in predicted food waste
-->Improved attendance planning accuracy
-->Identified key factors affecting daily and meal-wise attendance
-->Delivered a real-time decision support dashboard
-->Applied Industrial Engineering concepts: 
          1.Forecasting
          2.Optimization
          3.Statistical analysis
          4.Lean waste reduction


⚙️ Future Enhancements
1.IoT-based real-time attendance tracking
2.Cost optimization using OR models
3.Automated alerts & notifications
4.Multi-hostel cloud deployment
